# Automatic-Landcover-Classification-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In this project we have used different machine learning techniques like SVM, Decision Tree, KNNs and UNet for attempting automatic Landcover Classification. For detailed specifics please refer to the Detailed_Report.pdf file. Majority of the work on this project project was done in Google Colab and therefore it only contains the final version on Github.
